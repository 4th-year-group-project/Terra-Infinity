# Theory Folder
We note that the code in this folder is not used anywhere  in our application. It primarily exists to provide code which was used to generate figures in our final report. As such, formatting and testing guidelines do not apply to any of the files in this directory. With the exception of dla.py and dla_coalesce_parallel.py this code is not expected to be reliable and you add it to your development projects at your own risk.


## cdla_analysis 
Contains our experiments on distributional analysis of CDLA and the breakdown of CDLA at both high particle densities and in the formal 2-DLA prediction problem setting.

## fractal_analysis
Contains the code and images which were used to obtain estimates of the Minkowski dimension of DlA and our approximations.

## misc
A collection of miscellaneous code which is not to generate anything in the report. Included here for completenss as it contains some early experiments in speeding up DLA. This code may be poorly organised and commented.

## dla.py
Our implementation of standard DLA.

## dla_coalesce_parallel
Our implementation of CDLA.
